Coordinated at the regional level by the I&M\nprogram, data are collected on individual refuges and then call files are submitted to, processed, and\nvetted by I&M. Final data will be uploaded to the centralized Bat Population Database (BPD) for\nmanagement and analysis. Working on refuges in Oregon, Idaho, and Washington, USFWS joins the\nstate agencies of Idaho (IDFG) and Oregon (ODFW), and the National Park Service (NPS) in implementing\nthe NABat acoustic point monitoring protocol in the Pacific Northwest.\n\nImplementation was coordinated regionally by I&M and conducted locally by refuge staffs. R1 I&M\npurchased acoustic detectors and other equipment, prepared detailed field protocols and data forms,\nmanaged and vetted call files, and then submitted data to BPD. R1 I&M worked closely with refuge\nstaffs to choose sampling units. Refuge staffs chose point locations to sample and deployed detectors at\ntheir stations. Detailed guidance on sample site location was provided in regional NABat Initial Survey\nInstructions. Points were meant to be permanent for sampling in future years. Factors considered to\nselect sample locations included the following: minimizing clutter (dense vegetation and other\nobstructions), sampling a variety of bat habitats (water sources, bat travel corridors, and potential roost\nstructures), and elevation and orientation of the microphone.", "created_date": "2017-11-03T23:20:46.305343+00:00", "owning_organization": 3, "sample_design": 7, "sample_design_details": null, "mr_study_design": 1481, "mr_sample_design": null, "legacy": false, "mr_owner_email": "breichert@usgs.gov", "sample_frame": 14, "name": "US Fish and Wildlife Service", "address": "Fairfax Drive", "city": "Arlington", "state_province": "VA", "postal_code": "22203"}, {"id": 314, "project_key": "01f6ef30-571f-4600-b233-5bf3850ec42d", "project_name": "Lava Beds National Monument and Surrounding Area", "description": "Our NABat project includes colony counts as well as stationary and transect-based acoustic monitoring in prioritized GRTS cells within Lava Beds National Monument and the surrounding area.

A main objective of this project is to assemble and provide\na continental-scale database of colony counts by creating data-sharing tools and agreements that\nwill aid the WNS response community. The database will be used to assess geographic patterns\nand ecological drivers of colony size, hibernation behavior, and habitat associations for North\nAmerica\u2019s hibernating bat species and develop a model of species vulnerability across the\ncurrent and expanding range of WNS. Data-driven models will be used to predict regions and\nspecies most at risk to WNS to target management actions and surveillance efforts. This project\nleverages existing efforts to collect data on bat populations and will integrate directly with the\nNABat monitoring program and WNS national response. Improved data-sharing tools and a\nqueryable database can improve management response to WNS by 1) providing specific\nguidance on where, when, and how to conduct effective surveillance for Pseudogymnoascus\ndestructans (Pd) particularly at the disease frontier and in western regions; 2) identifying species\nand regions most vulnerable to WNS impacts at range-wide scales, and 3) assessing and\npredicting vulnerability and potential recovery of species across North America. As WNS has\ngrown from a regional disease impacting several species to a truly continental epidemic with\npotential to impact all hibernating species of bats in North America, the need for a\ncomprehensive database and continental-scale analysis of impacts as well as data-driven models\nto assess vulnerabilities and guide management and response is urgently needed.

They were derived from the North American Bat Monitoring Plan (NABat: Loeb et al. 2015). Six of the Network parks (Badlands NP1, Jewel Cave NM, Missouri NRR, Niobrara NSR, Theodore Roosevelt NP, and Wind Cave NP) use both the NABat protocol and 10 km2 sampling frame, i.e., they are part of the NABat monitoring. The other six parks (Agate Fossil Beds NM, Fort Laramie NHS, Fort Union Trading Post NHS, Knife River Indian Villages NHS, Mount Rushmore NMEM, and Scotts Bluff NM) did not meet the a priori criteria for inclusion in the NABat program, therefore, stationary points did not use that sampling frame nor were road surveys conducted at those parks; however, stationary point monitoring was conducted and used the same equipment and deployment schedules.\n\nBats were monitored using acoustic methods (see Brigham et al. 2004, Loeb et al. 2015). Acoustic monitoring consists of using automated recorders to detect and record the ultra-sonic calls that bats emit for echolocation. The recordings can be analyzed manually by people looking at a spectrogram of the call or auto-analyzed by software. The software outputs a probabilistic identification of the species that made the call. Although the method has limitations (e.g., some species have similar calls and hence, misidentification is possible), it is efficient and widely used for monitoring.\n\nMonitoring at stationary points used Wildlife Acoustics SM3Bat bat recorders2 connected to Wildlife Acoustics SM3-U1 ultrasonic microphones affixed about 2.5 m above the ground at the end of a tripod-supported pole. For mobile surveys the Network used Wildlife Acoustic EM3+ recorders connected to a Wildlife Acoustics SMX-UT microphone affixed to the roof of the vehicle. A GPS unit was also connected to the EM3+ recorder thereby capturing the spatial coordinates of each mobile recording. Configuration settings for both types of recorders (e.g., the decibel and frequency level that triggered recordings) were consistent with the recommendations in NABat (Loeb et al. 2015) and were explicitly listed in Licht (2018).\n\nAt each park 4-20 permanent stationary points were monitored each year starting in 2014 or 2015. Recorders were typically deployed for seven days, usually between June 1 and mid-August. Road routes of 25-48 km (16-30 miles) were established for each NABat cell at the 6 parks monitored as part of that program. Mobile surveys were conducted by driving at about 32 kph (20 mph) starting 30 minutes after sunset. Each mobile route was typically surveyed twice in summer of each year.\n\nThe recordings were analyzed using both Wildlife Acoustics Kaleidoscope version 4 and Sonobat version 4 software. Manual vetting was not conducted due in part to the large sample size. Licht (2018) compared the output from the two software packages; however, it is still unclear as to what software is more accurate. The results reported here are from Kaleidoscope.", "created_date": "2018-04-06T21:23:42.310743+00:00", "owning_organization": 4, "sample_design": 7, "sample_design_details": null, "mr_study_design": 1492, "mr_sample_design": null, "legacy": false, "mr_owner_email": "breichert@usgs.gov", "sample_frame": 14, "name": "National Park Service", "address": null, "city": null, "state_province": null, "postal_code": null}, {"id": 284, "project_key": "a24ef3f6-2a1b-4454-810d-1655284e5cce", "project_name": "Bureau of Land Management-Royal Gorge Field Office Bat Monitoring", "description": "PURPOSE\nBat occupancy and abundance data in Colorado is less comprehensive than most other groups of mammals in the state.
